Dot Net Framework : is a software component that runs on windows operating system
-provides a set of tools and libraries to enable faster and easier application developments

It is a Microsoft Web Services Strategy to connect information, people, systems and devices thru software

It is a platform that provides a standardised set of services
   Data Access (ADO.Net)
   User Interfaces (WPF, WinForms)
   Web Applications (ASP.Net,Silverlight)
   Network Communications (WCF/WWF)

Consists of major components viz:
   - Common Language Specification (CLS) 
        Common Type Specification (CTS)
   - Framework class library  (FCL) > 7000 odd classes to enable applications to read/write files, access databases, process xml, display graphics, distributed web services etc.. 
   - Common Language Runtime  (CLR)
   - Dotnet Tools


Kinds of Application
1. Desktop - deployed in each machine
      Console, Windows application

2. Web - Internet based, accessed thru browsers
      ASP.Net.MVC Core

3. Mobile - Mobile enabled
      Xamarin


Points to Remember:

- IL(Intermediate Lang.) is also called as MSIL, CIL, Managed Code)
- Dot Net Application on execution contains 2 steps
    - compilation (conversion of source code to IL). This creates an Assembly 
    - Execution on JIT Compilation  (conversion of IL to specific native code - Machine /OS dependent)

- Native code is not stored anywhere. Once program execution is over, it is discarded. Created again when we execute the program again

The IL is known as an Assembly

- Assemblies in Dotnet are of 2 types based on the type application we create
   .exe  (console application, windows application)
   .dll   (library applications, web application)

Assemblies :
 - Any .net applications on compilation gives assembly files(.exe, .dll)
 - Assemblies are fundamental Units of deployment, version control, reuse and security for a .net application
 - They contain - PE Header(portable header), CLR Header, IL and Manifest files
 - Manifest files contain metadata
 - Assemblies can be either private or shared 
 - Shared Assemblies are placed in GAC (Global Assembly Cache)

 - We can peek into an assemblies manifest and IL files using tools like
     ILDASM - IL Dis assembler (export the IL to a text file)
     ILASM - IL Assembler (to reconstruct an assembly from the text file)

GAC
 Machine wide central repository of assemblies
 They should have strong names
 A strong name consists of simple text name, version number, culture information(if provided), a public key and a digital signature
  Use gacutil /i for installing the signed assembly into GAC
  Use gacutil /u for uninstalling the assembly from the GAC
