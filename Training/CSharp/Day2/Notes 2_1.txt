   Logical     (not,and,or)
   Assignment  (=)
   Misc.  
      sizeof(), typeof(), ?, is, as, ?? etc. 

Arrays and Strings

Arrays : Array is a collection of values of same data type. It is a continuous memory allocation
   They are of 3 types : One-Diemension, 2 Dimension/Multi Dimension, Jagged 
   Arrays are operated using an Index or subscript reference (memory address)
   Hence arrays are known as reference type datatype

Array Instantiation : 
   Datatype [] Arrayname = new Datatype[size]
   Datatype : Specifies what type of data is stored
   Arrayname : indicates the name of the array
   new : keyword that allocates memory at the runtime
   Size : indicates number of elements

  int [] arr1 = new int[5];
  int [] arr2 = new int[5]{1,3,5,7,9};
  int [] arr3 = new int[]{10,20,30,40,50,60};
  
jagged arrays : are also called array of arrays
                An element of a jagged array itself is an array
                Size indicates no.of arrays stored in a jagged array

int[][] jarray = new int[3][]; - here 3 represents  no.of arrays in the Jagged array (this can be tested using Length property of the array)
 
Strings in C# : 
   strings are a collection of characters 
   they are allocated in the heap memory
   they are predefined reference type
   they have fixed size
   they are immutable
   string memory cannot be changed dynamically
      string str="abc";
      string s1="C:\\Banu\\Infinite\\B3";
      string s2=s1;
      string s3= new string(char[] c)

StringBuilder Class of C# : They are like strings, but are mutable
